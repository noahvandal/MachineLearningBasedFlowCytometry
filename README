The 'TrainUNET' has python files that allow for training a binary (or multiclass, with revisions) segmentation mask given input files. The dataset structure should be as follows: 

TrainDataset 
--Images
--Masks
ValDataset
--Images
--Masks


The 'TrainClassification' folder has files that allow for training the classification model, as predefined in the 'classifierNets.py' or hyperparamSearch.py files. The datset strucutre should be as follows: 

Dataset (with names denoting class in each file name, and a train split (6/3/1 used) defined)


The 'FindClassificationNetwork' folder has files that were used to find the ideal classification network, using the Optuna package from python. 


The 'Inference' folder contains the python files to run inference on a set of videos after models have been trained. The script 'realTimeInference.py' is what is run to inference a list of videos contained in a folder. 


The 'Auxiliary' folder has a list of python files that are used for post processing or other purposes not directly related to inferencing or training, but that proved useful during our code creation process.
